# DriveChain API Documentation

## Overview

The DriveChain API provides a comprehensive set of endpoints for interacting with our blockchain-based automotive service platform. Our API follows RESTful principles and uses JSON for data exchange. All endpoints are secured and require proper authentication.

## Authentication

To access our API, you'll need to authenticate your requests. We use a token-based authentication system. When making requests, include your authentication token in the request headers. The token should be obtained through our authentication endpoint.

## Service Records

### Creating Service Records

To create a new service record, you'll need to provide essential information about the service performed. This includes details about the vehicle, the type of service, and the service provider. The system will generate a unique identifier for the record and store it on the blockchain.

### Retrieving Service Records

You can access service records in several ways:
- Fetch a specific record using its unique identifier
- Retrieve all records associated with a particular vehicle
- Get records for a specific service provider
- Query records within a date range

### Verifying Service Records

Each service record can be verified for authenticity. The verification process checks the record's existence on the blockchain and validates its integrity.

## Points System

### Checking Points Balance

You can check the points balance for any registered address. The system will return the current balance and any pending transactions.

### Transferring Points

Points can be transferred between registered addresses. The system ensures the transaction is valid and updates the balances accordingly.

### Transaction History

View the complete history of points transactions for any address. The history includes details about transfers, timestamps, and transaction statuses.

## Event Management

### Creating Events

Create new events with specific details about the event type, participants, and associated data. Events are stored on the blockchain for transparency and immutability.

### Querying Events

Retrieve events based on various criteria:
- Event type
- Participant address
- Date range
- Event status

## Error Handling

Our API provides clear error messages to help you identify and resolve issues. Each error response includes:
- A unique error code
- A descriptive message
- Suggested actions to resolve the issue

## Rate Limiting

To ensure fair usage and system stability, our API implements rate limiting. Each endpoint has specific limits on the number of requests allowed within a time period.

## Best Practices

When integrating with our API, we recommend:
- Implementing proper error handling
- Caching responses when appropriate
- Following the rate limits
- Using the latest API version
- Implementing retry logic for failed requests
