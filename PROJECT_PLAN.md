  - [x] Verify service records

- [x] PointsSystem.sol
  - [x] Track points balance
  - [x] Transfer points
  - [x] Manage service type multipliers

### 2.2 Backend API
- [x] Express server setup
- [x] Service record endpoints
  - [x] POST /api/service-records/mint
  - [x] GET /api/service-records/:tokenId
  - [x] GET /api/service-records/:tokenId/verify
- [x] Points system endpoints
  - [x] GET /api/points/balance/:address
  - [x] POST /api/points/transfer
  - [x] GET /api/points/multipliers

### 2.3 Frontend Application
- [x] React application setup
  - [x] Project structure
  - [ ] Dependencies installation (waiting for Node.js)
  - [x] TypeScript configuration
  - [x] Tailwind CSS setup

- [x] Core components
  - [x] ServiceRecordForm
  - [x] PointsSystem
  - [x] BlockchainContext
  - [x] ErrorBoundary

- [x] Smart contract integration
  - [x] Contract ABIs
  - [x] Blockchain utilities
  - [x] Wallet connection
